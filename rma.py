rma.py - Run Mesh Analysis

This script runs the TeslaMax model with various mesh configurations
and plot the results for high field and computing time.

"""

# Define constant parameters for the TeslaMax model

# Define variable parameters for the TeslaMax model

# Define the default mesh parameters to test
# and a range of mesh parameters around it

# Define where to save the simulation files

# For each mesh configuration, and for each geometry:
#  run the model,
#  calculate the maximum magnetic field,
#  while computing the time required for that computation
#  and the number of mesh elements

# Create plots of B and t as function of number of elements,
# with curves for each geometry
